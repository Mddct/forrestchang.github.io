<h2 id="toc_0"><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-i-became-and-stayed-a-successful-programmer-48f209362f68#.davwu8c5x">How I became (and stayed) a successful programmer</a></h2>

<p>How do I take a new skill like programming, grow it, shape it, and tune it over time so I can achieve longevity in the industry?</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">1. I surround myself with programmers who are way better than me</h3>

<p>The best way to improve (at anything) is to learn from people better than you.</p>

<p>I remind myself to talk less and to listen more.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">2. I occasionally leave my comfort zone</h3>

<p>Leaving comfort zone helps me think differently by challenging a bunch of established ideas I already have.</p>

<p>Maybe you don&#39;t want to do this constantly because it can be hard to get into a rhythm with your normal area of work. But in moderation it can really open your mind to new ways of thinking.</p>

<p>Find a programming task that takes you out of your comfort zone and make it your next project. Then watch it pay off in spades.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">3. I value being independent</h3>

<p>What&#39;t most inportant is how you choose to find the answers to your questions.</p>

<p>This means I&#39;ll try to do most things myself first, and only when I really get stuck, I&#39;ll ask for help.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>You learn how to be resourceful.</li>
<li>You earn respect by being courteous of other people&#39;s time and work.</li>
<li>You start developing your creativity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4"><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/please-dont-quit-every-expert-was-once-a-beginner-6d8f8933a338#.d0nbkocf7">Please don&#39;t quit -- every expert was once a beginner</a></h2>

<h3 id="toc_5">Great developments never come from within your comfort zone</h3>

<p>It&#39;s always hard to push yourself to the next level, because it requires greater effort than the usual. It requires more energy, which may tire you physically and mentally.But don&#39;t think about that. Think about the result. The achievement.</p>

<p>Every time you take a step toward expertise, no matter how small, it is still a step.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Learn in diffuse mode</h3>

<p>Since it may be hard to get a concept the first time you read about it, you can do something that will make it better for you and help you get it quickly.</p>

<p>Read the full text with total focus (first time, even if you don&#39;t understand), okay? Now, read it again. After the second time, google the concept and try to read about it in different articles. That will help you see it from different angles, which will help you better understand it.</p>

<p>Next time is to read the text a third time. Your understanding of the concept is much better now than it was the first time you read it, even though in all likelihood you&#39;re still early on in your quest to truly understand that concept.</p>

<p>This medhod is called <strong>Diffuse mode</strong>. You can apply this type of learning toward applies to videos and tutorials, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Every expert was once a beginner.</strong></p>

<p>You should know that reaching a high level takes time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m convinced that about half of what separates the successful Entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.&quot; - <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t work alone.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t wait for inspiration. <strong>Discipline is reliable.</strong></li>
<li>Real work usually isn&#39;t fun.</li>
<li>Practice, practice, and practice.</li>
<li>Tutorials fish on your behalf, so you don&#39;t need to learn how to fish yourself. <strong>You need to read books.</strong></li>
<li>Always try to understand a new concept using different resources.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t just read. Build. Try, try, and keep trying.</li>
<li>Frustration, boredom, tiredness, exhaustion -- these are all normal. </li>
<li>Ask.</li>
</ul>
